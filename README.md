- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Waleed Khalid Bin Salman, senior comupter engineering student at King AbdulAziz University.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI, Robotics, Network
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently woking with my team mates on our senior project, which is Automatic Detection of Wrongly Parked Cars in Parking Building. 
      Our team aims to provide a time-saving solution that fully automates the process of reporting a wrongly parked car. Additionally,
      provide a simple and easy user interface, and finally, build a reliable database to easily access and keep track of all the records. The solution can be
      easily extended to help users find empty spots by displaying information on the main screen at the entrance.
